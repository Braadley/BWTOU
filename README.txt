• Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

Text and tittle have been correctly implemented, but when it comes to tables, some of them are screenshots. 
This is because some of the symbols in the table could not be found and creating all of them would require 
a significant amount of time.

• Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed
the assignment.

I worked alone on this assignment.

• Include how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

Approximately 14 hours to build the website.
